Activity log:
Feb24: I created two tables and explained the PK and FK constraints, as well showed the examples to ensure the relation integrity. Morover made third table to show how ALTER works.
Feb27: I created another table in which I used CHECK,NOT NULL,UNIQUE constraints, and made several insertions to show the errors which those constraints create.
Mar1: Created two tables (students and their enrollments) to demonstrate 3 types of outer joins, inner join, and natural join.
Mar3: Used student table and added the columns to create a view and materialized view, and their difference in terms of update or insert.
Mar4: First I have built the unnormalized table Fragrance store, then by using insert as select and create as select splitted it into two tables. Moreover completed the last task which was about demonstration of transaction functions commit and rollback.

I was using a local pgadmin server on my mac, and performed all operations in the PostgreSQL Terminal. The preparation also included checking all slides with Introduction and Intermediate SQL chapters which was provided, and looking for syntax in browser, recordings and youtube video tutorials.
After that I was practicing with basic commands , and started to solve the tasks. After solving each task, I was recording a video where i demonstrated my approach, and writing the code. I was using my note for insertions which I was preparing before recording, to efficiently use the time, and dont waste it on thinking on examples to insert or update in the created tables;

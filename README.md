Assignment 2 Database Systems (CSCI3615)
Malik Malikov

Activity log:
Feb24: I created two tables and explained the PK and FK constraints, as well showed the examples to ensure the relation integrity. Furthermore, made the third table to show how ALTER works.
Feb27: I created another table in which I used CHECK, NOT NULL,UNIQUE constraints, and made several insertions to show the errors which those constraints create.
Mar1: Created two tables (students and their enrollments) to demonstrate 3 types of outer joins, inner join, and natural join.
Mar3: Used student table and added the columns to create a view and materialized view, and their difference in terms of update or insert.
Mar4: First, I have built the unnormalized table Fragrance store, then by using insert as select and create as select split it into two tables. Moreover, I completed the last task which was about demonstration of transaction functions commit and rollback.


IMPORTANT NOTE!
Run each task one by one, and insert in the tables while creation of them ( f.e you created table teams, first insert the data in teams, then move to creation of table players, in other case it will give an error of foreign key constraint, because you insert into players first then in teams , but players have dependency).

Preparation and solution:

I was using a local pgadmin server on my mac and performed all operations in the PostgreSQL Terminal.

(I used this video to learn how to install PgAdmin on mac)

The preparation also included checking all slides with Introduction and Intermediate SQL chapters which was provided, and looking for syntax in browser, recordings and youtube video tutorials.
After that I was practicing with basic commands and started to solve the tasks. After solving each task, I was recording a video where i demonstrated my approach and writing the code. I was using my note for insertions which I was preparing before recording, to efficiently use the time, and donâ€™t waste it on thinking on examples to insert or update in the created tables.
I had some difficulties with last task, which was separating unnormalized table into two tables by using create as select and insert as select, but I referred to my lecture notes and when I have totally understood it, the process went smoothly.
As a conclusion I finished all tasks with completing the given instructions, and recorded a video of explanation and performance of each task.

Thank you for attention, hope you have enjoyed watching my video explanation.
